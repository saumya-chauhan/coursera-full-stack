## About This Specialization

The first two courses in this Specialization include an orientation to client-side development, covering HTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, and frameworks such as AngularJS and Bootstrap. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework and Cordova. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to build a fully functional web and hybrid mobile application with back-end support.

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This course will teach you the essential elements of web page development, covering HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No previous experience of these technologies is necessary, although it is helpful if you have some prior programming experience. First, HTML together with CSS are discussed and explored. Then we move on to consider the essential components of JavaScript, including variables, arrays, loops, events and functions. Then we explore more advanced elements of JavaScript control, including advanced use of functions, event control, array processing, and DOM manipulation.

## Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools

This course will give you an overview of client-side web frameworks, in particular Bootstrap. You will learn about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. You will learn about CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. You will also learn the basics of Node.js and NPM and learn about Web tools like Bower.

## Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS

This course concentrates mainly on Javascript based front-end frameworks, and in particular, AngularJS, the most popular among them. We will review the model view controller (MVC) design-pattern in the context of AngularJS. You will be introduced to various aspects of AngularJS including two-way data binding and angular directives and filters. You will then be introduced to angular controllers and scopes. UI routing and templates will then be reviewed. Finally we will look at angular modules and services. Single page application (SPA) development using Angular will also be explored. You must have either completed the previous course in the specialization on Bootstrap, or have a working knowledge of Bootstrap to be able to navigate this course.

## Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies

This course focuses on developing multiplatform mobile applications using the Web skills (HTML5, CSS and Javascript) that you have already acquired so far in the previous courses of this specialization. In particular we make use of the Cordova hybrid application framework to develop and target multiple mobile platforms with a single codebase. We make use of the Ionic framework, one of fastest growing mobile application frameworks, that is built with mobile-optimized HTML5 and CSS based components and AngularJS. You will learn about UI development with Ionic and then using Cordova's modules to access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript. You should have already completed the Bootstrap and the AngularJS courses in this specialization before proceeding with this course. Alternately you should already have sufficient knowledge of Bootstrap and AngularJS before you proceed with this course.

## Server-side Development with NodeJS

This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. We examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API. We touch upon authentication and security. Finally we review backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.

## Full Stack Web Development Specialization Capstone Project

The Capstone project is the culmination of your journey through the Full Stack Web Development specialization. The Capstone project is aimed at building a fully functional front-end Application (both Web App designed using Bootstrap+AngularJS, and hybrid mobile app implemented using the Ionic framework) and full server-side implementation using Node.js+Express+MongoDB (possibly using a higher level framework). The project provides you an opportunity to demonstrate the skills that you have acquired from the courses within the specialization.
